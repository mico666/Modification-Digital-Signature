# Modification-Digital-Signature-Scheme

This repository implements a Modification-Tolerant Signature Scheme (MTSS) based on the thesis Modification-Tolerant Signature Schemes using Combinatorial Group Testing: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementation. The scheme allows digital signatures to be verified even with certain modifications, ensuring reliable integrity and authenticity checks.
